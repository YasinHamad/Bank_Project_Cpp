# How to Run/Use
- Open the repo with your Visual Studio.
- In the project, there are mainly two source `cpp` files, include the one you want to run, and exclude the one you don't want.
- At first, they both will be included.
- How to exclude/include? -> click on `show all files` in solution explorer
- Right click on the file `BanK_Project_Cpp.cpp` or `ATM_System_Cpp.cpp` then choose `include in project` or `exclude from project`
- You should have only one included file - `BanK_Project_Cpp.cpp` or `ATM_System_Cpp.cpp`
